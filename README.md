## I have been interested in some machine learning projects for a while. So I decided to work on some papers and build some projects on a regular basis to showcase.

1. I have built a Deep Convolutional GAN using the paper "Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks" by Alec Radford, Luke Metz, Soumith Chintala.
The link to the paper is shown here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf
